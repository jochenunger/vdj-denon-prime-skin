# Best Virtual DJ Skin for PrimeGO and Prime4

This project develops an improved Skin/User-Interface for Virtual DJ for screens of controllers like the *Denon Prime 4* and the *Denon Prime GO*. 

The new Skin features beside the standard features:
* The  *Prime GO* get support to handle **full 4 deck**.
* All devices are able to do **video mixing** without the need to look on the laptop screen any more.
* All devices get full **vertical wave-line support** for 2 and 4 decks.
* All devices get a day-light scheme which makes them better usable und bright conditions.
* Use the browser to **edit tags**, to mark songs and to **prelisten to songs** before loading them into a deck.
* Wanna listen to the song, that is currently playing to check how to mix best? The skin **supports VDJs sandbox mode** to listen to any song-position of the master song while the audience keeps listening to the song the *normal* way.

Here are some images to show you the new views of the skin:

## Why should I use this Skin?
This skin adds a great new value to the controller and makes a huge difference on what you can do with your controller. Especially compared to the standalone Engine DJ software.

## Motivation
VDJ is the most customizable DJ mixing tool that exist. It is incredible feature-rich and implements advanced features like just in time stems separation with awesome quality. It is a full video-mixing tool and supports nearly every controller out there.

But the best feature is that everything can be customized. It supports a script language that can be used to do anything you want on a button press or a fader move. And the whole UI is defined with an XML-syntax so that everybody is free to adjust, extend, or completely redesign the UI on the laptop screen , but on the controller screen, as-well.

I've been using the default skins for the Prime 4 for some time now and always thought that some features, VDJ can do, were missing in the screen of the controller.

So I decided to learn the script language and the XML syntax to improve the UI to my needs and to make the devices more usable and feature rich.
